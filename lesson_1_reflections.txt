By using version control you can easily spot
the differences between two versions of the
same program. This will allow you to easily
spot bugs if they arise from an accidental
change of the code.

By having easy access to the entire history
of a file you can easily go back and see all
of the different iterations that were tried.
This allows you to not repeat past mistakes
or inefficiencies.

A manual commit allows you to create commits
at the best times and after meaningful changes
have been made. Automatic commits are better
if you are forgetful but may create commits 
at insignificant or confusing times.

Google Docs does not know which files should
be kept together; however, as Git was designed
expressly for code and most coding projects
involve more than one file, it allows saving
multiple files in one commit.

You use git log to see all of the commits. And
you use git diff to view the changes between two
commits.

Version control allows you to be much more
comfortable when making changes as you are able
to easily revert to a functioning state.

I want to start using Git for keeping track of
the changes I made to my code.
